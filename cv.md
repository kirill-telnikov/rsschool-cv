### About Myself

My first job was a system administrator. Thus began my acquaintance with computers. After 3-4 years, I started doing seo website promotion and creating websites on different CMS. This is where I first learned about html and css. Our acquaintance did not last long. Then there was a long way to the head of the online store. And now, after almost 10 years, I again decided to learn html, css and javascript and become a Frontend developer.
